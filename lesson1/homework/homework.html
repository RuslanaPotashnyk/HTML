<h1>The Simpsons</h1>
<p>
    The Simpsons is an American adult animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.
    The series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer,
    Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American
    culture and society, television, and the human condition.
    The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer
    James L. Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members,
    substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to
    "simpleton". The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the
    sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in
    a season (1989–1990).
